Errors and problems encountered:

    Smoothly coloring the ncurses display and bitmap was a bit of a challenge to
wrap my head around but I'm pretty proud of the results. A consequence of this though is that the is_in_set
function doesn't simply return true or false but the value mu which corresponds to the exit value of the point
c normalized with respect to infinity. Once I properly implemented this and linear interpolation of colors the
output looks great which was fun to see. I also had to fix way too many segfaults relating to ncurses menus
and forms but gdb and a healthy amount of googling got it working.

Concerns:

    I added some functionality to this program that might slightly bend the guidelines such as the change in what
is_in_set returns as mentioned above. I also included the forms and menus libraries which are extensions to ncurses
to make the user interface more friendly and include the possibility for the user to pick different color palettes
for the bitmap export. I hope this won't detract from the grade because I feel these features really add to the program
The provided makefile will build mandelbrot.c with these libraries included.

    Another concern I had when testing this is that OSX doesn't seem to support the BITMAPCOREHEADER format. The
default image viewer says that it is incapable of opening the bitmaps generated by this program and safari simply
shows a broken image icon. However it can be opened and viewed in Google Chrome without issue. Linux and Windows
don't seem to have this same problem.

I have neither given nor received assistance on this assignment
